# Bikeminer
This repository is for the advanced software engineering lecture 2022 at DHBW-Mannheim

**Bikeminer** is an Android based app that sends the GPS data of the smartphone to a server. The server processes the data and rewards the user with points.

### Why Bikeminer?
The goal of the Bikeminer is to develop a system that encourages users to ride their bicycles more often. This ensures that the traffic on the roads improves and thus less time is lost due to traffic jams in large cities. Furthermore, the reduced amount of cars in big cities makes for a better climate. The use of the bicycle, in addition to receiving virtual currency, also provides an improvement in health.
