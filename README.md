### Why Bikeminer?
The goal of the Bikeminer is to develop a system that encourages users to ride their bicycles more often. This ensures that the traffic on the roads improves and thus less time is lost due to traffic jams in large cities. Furthermore, the reduced amount of cars in big cities makes for a better climate. The use of the bicycle, in addition to receiving virtual currency, also provides an improvement in health.
